# Pizza-Sales-Project-Excel-Dashboard
In this project, I will use excel to perform analysis of pizza sales data and create a dashboard.

## Insights:
-  Our most popular pizza is The Classic Deluxe Pizza, but it generates the fourth-most profit. This pizza is mainly brought in a medium size.
-  The pizza that generates the most revenue is The Thai Chicken Pizza, despite it being the fifth-most popular pizza.
-  The most popular category is Classic, which accounts for 30% of sales.
-  The least popular category is Chicken, which accounts for 22% of sales.
-  March, May, July and November were the months with the highest revenue; each earning over £70,000. In these months, the Barbecue Chicken Pizza had the most sales and generated the most profit.
-  February, September and October were the months with the lowest revenue; each earning under £65,000 or less. The Pepperoni Pizza was the most sold pizza during these months, but only ranks 10th in revenue.
-  Our busiest periods throughout the day are 12-1pm and 5-6pm.
-  Garlic, Tomatoes, Red Peppers and Red Onions are the most used ingredients.

## Suggestions:
- Consider raising the price of the Classic Deluxe Pizza, due to its popularity. If the price increase doesn't significantly reduce orders, this could lead to more revenue generated. Alternatively, you could also consider convincing customers to upgrade to a large pizza as this pizza is most commonly brought in a medium size.
- Introduce promotions including the Thai Chicken Pizza to increase sales as it it the pizza that generates the most revenue.
- Introduce seasonal promotions during months where the revenue generated is low. Consider centering these promotions around the Pepperoni Pizza due to its popularity in these months. For example, you could introduce a promotion in which customers can get a discount if the purchase the Pepperoni at a larger size.
- Use the Barbecue Chicken Pizza to boost sales of less popular pizzas during the peak months where the Barbcue Chicken Pizza sells well.
- During peak hours, make sure popular ingredients are well stocked and enough staff are scheduled to keep up with increased demand.
